Hello, my name is Nguyen, I am working for TotalEnergies as a Deep Learning Reseacher and Computer Vision Engineer for my end-of-studies internship (6 months). I am working on the project " Satellite Imagery & AI : Prediction of solar photovoltaic potential from open data". A set of 4 algorithms have been developped until now (3rd month of my internship):

1. Roof segmentation: given an images detect roof geometry
2. Roof materials: given a roof indicates the composition zinc, ardoise and so on (work not that great ;))
3. Obstacle detection: given a roof indicates obstacle like window etc.
4. Panels layout: given a roof with corresponding obstacles a set of panels put in free space

Note : The results showed are not definitive, there is still room for improvement in the next months. 

This work is private to TotalEnergies so I cannot show you the codes behind, here are some results until now :
